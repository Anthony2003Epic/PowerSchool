Place the students.csv or faculty.csv file exported from PowerSchool into the students or faculty directory respectively.

import.bat runs the patron import into Destiny and should be set as a Scheduled Task on the server.
(Using the automate scripts provided by destiny didn't work, but this does and is simpler).


CSV Format
-------
The file exported from PowerSchool should have these fields in this order:

For students.csv:
Student Number,Id,Grade Level,Home Room,Last Name,First Name,Dob,Ltis Dragonnet Username

For faculty.csv:



Files
-------

convert_students.properties = The settings used by Patron Import Converter (when parsing the .csv)

import.bat = Runs the CSV conversion and imports the generated XML to Destiny

students-log.txt = The log file from the Patron Import Converter. This will have many lines saying it can't match students. Those students are ones whose Grade Level in PowerSchool is not between 1 and 12.

students.csv = The exported data from PowerSchool. Overwrite this file with the latest data. (Keep the format the same though! If you change the format of this file, also edit convert_students.properties)

students.xml = The output generated by the Patron Import Converter from students.csv. Don't edit this file as it is automatically generated

update_students.properties = The settings used when importing the students.xml file


Important! The first time it runs
-------

District ID is not set on all current student entries in Destiny, only Barcode is.
To populate the District ID field, edit convert_students.properties and change
MatchUsingDistrictID=true
to
MatchUsingDistrictID=false

Then run import.bat once

After that, change back to MatchUsingDistrictID=true and future matches will be made using the now filled District ID instead of Site Name + Barcode. This allows students to be moved from Elementary School to Secondary School automatically, as the DistrictID is a unique ID across the entire installation, not just per site.
